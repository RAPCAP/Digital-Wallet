## Notes

<b>POV</b>: I think that every app may be better if we spend more time on them. I focused on code style, and safe types, and show you how I usually implement features and layout

### I skipped:

- internationalization
- using UI kit
- full setup repo: linter, precommiter and etc

Also, I preferred to use modal window from navigation as new experience, usually, I used <i>react-native-modalize</i>
